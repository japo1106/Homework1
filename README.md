## Business Activities:


Commercial real estate investment often relies on intimate knowledge, gut instinct and the experience of property owners and veteran real estate professionals. Many of them are very good at what they do, but all humans make mistakes, have inherent biases, and make both good and bad investment decisions. In short, the processing power of a human with an excel sheet is a very inefficient way to cope with the tremendous amount of data that exists around any deal – even more so when attempting to identify trends in neighborhoods, MSA’s or entire markets.

Currently, real estate investors are facing tight market conditions and holding close to $300 billion in dry powder (idle capital that is waiting to be deployed) – record levels, according to recent research. As investors struggle to identify market anomalies and promising opportunities, it’s increasingly clear that while the real estate world has fine-tuned the calculations necessary to drive intelligent investment decisions, relying on human expertise alone has resulted in firms holding onto their cash and forgoing billions of dollars in untapped value. On top of all that, many predict that the current cycle is soon coming to an end. This unpredictability solidifies the notion that what worked in the industry five years ago won’t suffice today or in the future. The market is on the cusp of seismic change, and those who are agile enough to adopt new strategies and technologies are going to dominate the new economic reality.

Skyline AI is injecting advanced technology into the core of commercial real estate acquisition and ownership process. Utilizing the largest data lake in the industry, Skyline AI says to be able to predict the value and future behavior of any commercial asset in the US by detecting and exploiting market anomalies, identifying superior risk-reward investments, and discovering untapped value creation opportunities. Ultimately, Skyline AI argues not only identifies smart deals, but it also promises to opens the door to a wider pool of deals. The AI platform may discourage an investor from completing a deal already in the pipeline or recommend a deal that seemed unfavorable according to human analysis.

Skyline AI is focused in targeting Commercial Real Estate Investors and big players in the CRE industry that complement their business model.
